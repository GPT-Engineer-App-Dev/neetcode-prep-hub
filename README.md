# Welcome to your GPT Engineer project

## Project info

**Project**: neetcode-prep-hub 

**URL**: https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID/improve

**Description**: In your initial prompt, provide this exact description, copied verbatim.

```
### Purpose
The NeetCode landing page is designed to help users prepare effectively for coding interviews through a structured and interactive interface. Here’s a detailed description of the page:

#### Header:
- **Navigation Bar**: Located at the top of the page, the navigation bar includes:
  - **Logo**: A rocket icon symbolizing NeetCode, placed at the leftmost corner.
  - **Menu Items**: Three primary links labeled "Courses," "Practice," and "Roadmap," providing easy access to different sections of the platform.
  - **Pro Account Button**: A button labeled "Pro," highlighted in green, for users to upgrade their account.
  - **Sign In Button**: A "Sign in" button on the right side for users to access their accounts.
  - **Dark/Light Mode Switch**: An icon to toggle between dark mode and light mode, enhancing user experience based on their preference.

#### Main Content:
- **Hero Section**:
  - **Title**: Boldly displays "NeetCode."
  - **Tagline**: "A better way to prepare for coding interviews," succinctly describes the platform’s purpose.
  - **Call-to-Action Button**: A green button labeled "Get Pro" encourages users to upgrade for additional features.

- **Flowchart Section**:
  - **Description**: The flowchart visually outlines various coding interview topics and their interconnections.
  - **Nodes and Connections**:
    - **Arrays & Hashing**: This root node branches into:
      - **Two Pointers**
      - **Stack**
    - **Two Pointers**: This intermediate node branches into:
      - **Sliding Window**
      - **Linked List**
    - **Stack**: This intermediate node branches into:
      - **Binary Search**
    - **Linked List** and **Binary Search** converge into:
      - **Trees**
    - **Trees**: This central node branches into:
      - **Tries**
      - **Heap / Priority Queue**
      - **Backtracking**

Each node represents a key topic in coding interviews, with branches illustrating the progression and connections between these topics. For instance, understanding Arrays & Hashing can lead to mastering Two Pointers and Stack, which further branch into more specialized areas like Sliding Window and Linked List.

### Visual Design:
- **Theme**: The page uses a dark theme by default, providing a modern and visually appealing look. The dark mode switch allows users to toggle between dark and light modes, accommodating different viewing preferences.
- **Layout**: The design is clean and minimalistic, focusing on guiding users through the preparation process with clarity and ease.

This comprehensive landing page layout ensures that users have a clear understanding of the preparation path for coding interviews, starting from basic concepts and advancing to more complex topics, all within an intuitive and interactive interface.

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain, then we recommend GitHub Pages.

To use GitHub Pages you will need to follow these steps: 
- Deploy your project using GitHub Pages - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)
- Configure a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
